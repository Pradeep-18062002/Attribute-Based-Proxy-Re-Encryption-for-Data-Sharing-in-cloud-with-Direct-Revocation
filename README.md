# Attribute-Based-Proxy-Re-Encryption-for-Data-Sharing-in-cloud-with-Direct-Revocation

The platform enabled real-time key revocation via SMTP, ensuring only selected users received access. It also integrated CSP monitoring for efficient access control and breach prevention through proactive key management.
